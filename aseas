3. <b> How to setup appointment requests going into your inbox</b> <br>
I made it work only on yahoo, gmail are closing a feature which allows other apps to use the email box<br>
The way it works is that the website uses an email to send one to itself with all the data the customer used.
    1. Go to yahoo account settings (create an account if you don't have one) and go to account info -> Security -> App password -> Generate and manage app passoword.
    2. Create an app password
    3. Create a file called `.env.local` and check `.gitignore` that contains that file as we don't want to share credentials on github.
    4. The file should look like: <br>
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL=email@yahoo.com`<br>
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_PASS=passowrd`
    5. Try to use the form and check the Terminal for errors if occured
